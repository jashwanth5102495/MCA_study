    unit: 'Unit III',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Simple interest is calculated only on the principal amount for the entire time period.',
      definition: 'Simple Interest = (Principal × Rate × Time) / 100, where rate is in percentage per annum.',
      realWorldExample: 'If you invest $1000 at 5% simple interest for 2 years, you earn $100 interest.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in banking, loans, and basic financial calculations.',
      importance: 'Fundamental concept in finance and essential for understanding interest calculations.',
      detailedExplanation: `Simple interest is calculated using the formula: SI = (P × R × T) / 100, where P is principal, R is rate of interest per annum, and T is time in years. The interest remains constant each year as it's calculated only on the original principal. This concept is fundamental in finance and is commonly tested in aptitude exams.`,

    unit: 'Unit III',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Compound interest is calculated on both principal and accumulated interest.',
      definition: 'Compound Interest = Principal × (1 + Rate/100)^Time - Principal.',
      realWorldExample: 'If you invest $1000 at 5% compound interest for 2 years, you earn $102.50 interest.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in investments, loans, and financial planning.',
      importance: 'Essential for understanding growth of investments and long-term financial planning.',
      detailedExplanation: `Compound interest uses the formula: CI = P(1 + R/100)^T - P. Interest is added to principal each period, so interest grows exponentially. This concept is crucial for understanding investment growth, loan calculations, and financial planning. Compound interest typically yields higher returns than simple interest over time.`,
