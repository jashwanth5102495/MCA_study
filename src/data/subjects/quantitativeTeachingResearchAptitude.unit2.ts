      introduction: 'Time and work problems involve calculating how long it takes to complete tasks when multiple people or machines work together.',
      definition: 'These problems use the concept that work done equals the product of time and efficiency (work rate).',
      realWorldExample: 'If 3 workers can complete a project in 10 days, how long would it take 5 workers to complete the same project?',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in project management, resource allocation, and efficiency calculations.',
      importance: 'Essential for understanding productivity, efficiency, and resource management.',
      detailedExplanation: `Time and work problems use the formula: Work = Time Ã— Efficiency. When multiple workers are involved, their individual work rates are added. Inverse relationship exists between time and number of workers. These problems help develop logical thinking and mathematical reasoning skills. Common scenarios include: workers with different efficiencies, work done in shifts, and work with breaks. Understanding these concepts is crucial for competitive exams and real-world applications.`,
