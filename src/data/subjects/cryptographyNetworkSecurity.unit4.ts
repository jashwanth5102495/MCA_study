      introduction: 'Digital signatures provide a way to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital messages or documents.',
      definition: 'A digital signature is a cryptographic value that is calculated from the data and a secret key known only by the signer.',
      realWorldExample: 'Digital signatures are used in software distribution to verify the source and integrity of files.',
