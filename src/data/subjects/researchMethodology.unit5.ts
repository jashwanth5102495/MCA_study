      introduction: 'Research reports come in various types, each serving different purposes and audiences.',
      definition: 'Different types of reports include technical reports, academic papers, business reports, and policy briefs, each with specific formats and requirements.',
      realWorldExample: 'A technical report might detail a new software algorithm, while a policy brief summarizes research findings for government decision-makers.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in academia, industry, government, and non-profit organizations.',
      importance: 'Understanding report types helps researchers communicate findings effectively to their target audience.',
      detailedExplanation: `Technical reports provide detailed technical information for specialists in the field. Academic papers follow scholarly conventions and are published in journals. Business reports focus on practical implications and recommendations. Policy briefs summarize research for policymakers. Each type has specific requirements for length, format, style, and content organization. Technical reports emphasize methodology and detailed results. Academic papers require rigorous literature review and theoretical framework. Business reports prioritize executive summaries and actionable recommendations. Policy briefs emphasize implications and policy recommendations. Understanding these differences ensures effective communication of research findings.`,

      introduction: 'Writing a research report involves systematic steps to ensure clarity, accuracy, and completeness.',
      definition: 'The writing process includes planning, drafting, revising, and editing to produce a coherent and well-structured report.',
      realWorldExample: 'A researcher might start with an outline, write a first draft, revise based on feedback, and finalize the report.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in academic writing, thesis preparation, and research documentation.',
      importance: 'Effective writing ensures that research findings are communicated clearly and professionally.',
      detailedExplanation: `The writing process begins with planning and outlining the report structure. Drafting involves writing each section systematically, starting with methodology and results, then introduction and discussion. Revising focuses on improving clarity, coherence, and logical flow. Editing addresses grammar, style, and formatting issues. Key principles include: writing clearly and concisely, using appropriate academic language, maintaining logical organization, and ensuring accuracy of information. The writing process is iterative, with multiple drafts and revisions. Peer review and feedback help improve quality. Final editing ensures consistency in formatting, citations, and style.`,

      introduction: 'Referencing is essential in academic writing to acknowledge sources and avoid plagiarism.',
      definition: 'Referencing involves citing sources used in research, following specific citation styles and formats.',
      realWorldExample: 'Academic papers use citation styles like APA, MLA, or Chicago to reference sources in the text and bibliography.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in academic writing, research papers, and scholarly publications.',
      importance: 'Proper referencing demonstrates academic integrity and allows readers to verify sources.',
      detailedExplanation: `Referencing includes in-text citations and a reference list or bibliography. Common citation styles include APA (American Psychological Association), MLA (Modern Language Association), Chicago, and Harvard. Each style has specific rules for formatting citations and references. In-text citations acknowledge sources within the text, while the reference list provides complete bibliographic information. Proper referencing avoids plagiarism, gives credit to original authors, and allows readers to locate sources. Electronic sources require special consideration for URLs, access dates, and digital object identifiers (DOIs). Reference management software helps organize and format citations consistently.`,
