      introduction: 'Research is a systematic investigation designed to discover new knowledge, validate existing knowledge, or solve practical problems.',
      definition: 'Research is a systematic and methodical investigation of a subject to discover or establish facts, theories, or principles.',
      realWorldExample: 'Google conducts extensive research on machine learning algorithms to improve search results and develop new AI technologies.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in academic studies, product development, policy making, medical discoveries, and technological innovations.',
      importance: 'Essential for advancing knowledge, solving complex problems, making informed decisions, and driving innovation in all fields.',
      detailedExplanation: `Research involves systematic inquiry using scientific methods to investigate phenomena, acquire new knowledge, or validate existing theories. The research process begins with identifying a problem or question, followed by literature review to understand existing knowledge. Research can be classified as basic (pure) research aimed at expanding knowledge, or applied research focused on solving practical problems. Quantitative research uses numerical data and statistical analysis, while qualitative research explores meanings, experiences, and social phenomena. Mixed methods combine both approaches. The research process includes formulating hypotheses, designing methodology, collecting and analyzing data, and drawing conclusions. Ethical considerations ensure research is conducted responsibly, protecting participants and maintaining integrity. Research contributes to evidence-based decision making in various fields including science, technology, medicine, education, and business.`,

    unit: 'Unit I',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Research design is the overall strategy that integrates different components of a study in a coherent and logical way.',
      definition: 'Research design is a framework or blueprint for conducting research that outlines how data will be collected, measured, and analyzed.',
      realWorldExample: 'Clinical trials use randomized controlled trial design to test new medications, ensuring reliable and valid results through careful experimental design.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in scientific studies, market research, social science investigations, and evaluation of programs and policies.',
      importance: 'Ensures research is conducted systematically, produces reliable results, and can be replicated by other researchers.',
      detailedExplanation: `Research design encompasses the overall approach and methodology for conducting research. Experimental designs involve manipulation of variables to establish cause-and-effect relationships, including true experiments, quasi-experiments, and pre-experiments. Descriptive designs aim to describe characteristics of populations or phenomena without manipulation, including surveys, case studies, and observational studies. Exploratory designs investigate new areas where little is known, while explanatory designs test theories and hypotheses. Cross-sectional designs collect data at one point in time, while longitudinal designs track changes over time. Sampling methods determine how participants are selected, including probability sampling (random, stratified, cluster) and non-probability sampling (convenience, purposive, snowball). Data collection methods include surveys, interviews, observations, experiments, and document analysis. Validity and reliability are crucial considerations in ensuring research quality.`,
