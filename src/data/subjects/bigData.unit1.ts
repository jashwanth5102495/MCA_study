      introduction: 'Big Data refers to datasets that are so large, complex, and rapidly changing that traditional data processing tools cannot handle them effectively.',
      definition: 'Big Data is characterized by the 5 Vs: Volume (massive amounts), Velocity (high speed), Variety (different formats), Veracity (data quality), and Value (meaningful insights).',
      realWorldExample: 'Facebook processes over 4 petabytes of data daily from user interactions, posts, photos, and videos across billions of users worldwide.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in social media analytics, healthcare diagnostics, financial fraud detection, recommendation systems, and IoT sensor data processing.',
      importance: 'Enables organizations to extract valuable insights from massive datasets, driving data-driven decision making and competitive advantages.',
      detailedExplanation: `Big Data represents a paradigm shift in how we collect, store, process, and analyze information. The concept emerged as organizations began generating data at unprecedented scales and speeds. Volume refers to the sheer amount of data - from terabytes to petabytes and beyond. Velocity encompasses both the speed at which data is generated and the speed required for processing. Variety includes structured data (databases), semi-structured data (XML, JSON), and unstructured data (text, images, videos). Veracity addresses data quality, accuracy, and trustworthiness. Value represents the ability to extract meaningful insights that drive business decisions. Traditional relational databases and processing tools struggle with these characteristics, necessitating new technologies and approaches like distributed computing, NoSQL databases, and specialized analytics platforms.`,

    subject: 'Big Data',
    unit: 'Unit I',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Enterprise structured data forms the backbone of traditional business operations, stored in organized formats like databases and spreadsheets.',
      definition: 'Structured data is highly organized information stored in predefined formats, typically in relational databases with rows, columns, and defined relationships.',
      realWorldExample: 'Banking systems store customer account information, transaction records, and loan details in structured databases with defined schemas and relationships.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in ERP systems, CRM platforms, financial reporting, inventory management, and traditional business intelligence applications.',
      importance: 'Provides reliable, consistent data foundation for business operations and enables efficient querying and reporting through SQL.',
      detailedExplanation: `Enterprise structured data represents the traditional approach to data management where information is organized in predefined schemas with clear relationships. This includes relational databases with tables, rows, and columns, where each field has a specific data type and constraints. Enterprise data typically includes customer information, financial records, inventory data, employee records, and operational metrics. The structured nature enables efficient storage, indexing, and querying using SQL. Data integrity is maintained through constraints, foreign keys, and normalization. However, structured data represents only a small fraction of total organizational data, with estimates suggesting it accounts for less than 20% of enterprise information. The rigid schema requirements can limit flexibility when dealing with evolving business needs or integrating diverse data sources.`,

    semester: 3,
    subject: 'Big Data',
    unit: 'Unit I',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Social and unstructured data encompasses the vast majority of digital information that lacks predefined organization or schema.',
      definition: 'Unstructured data refers to information that does not have a predefined data model or organization, including text, images, videos, social media posts, and sensor data.',
      realWorldExample: 'Twitter generates millions of tweets daily containing text, images, hashtags, and user interactions that require specialized tools for analysis and insights.',
      realWorldUse: 'Used in social media monitoring, sentiment analysis, content recommendation, market research, and customer behavior analysis.',
      importance: 'Represents 80-90% of all organizational data and contains valuable insights for understanding customer preferences, market trends, and business opportunities.',
      detailedExplanation: `Unstructured data represents the majority of information generated in the digital age, including social media posts, emails, documents, images, videos, audio files, web pages, and sensor readings. Social data specifically includes user-generated content from platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and YouTube. This data is characterized by its lack of predefined structure, making it challenging to store in traditional relational databases. The variety includes text in multiple languages, multimedia content, geolocation data, timestamps, and complex relationships between users and content. Processing unstructured data requires specialized techniques like natural language processing, computer vision, and machine learning algorithms. The value lies in understanding customer sentiment, identifying trends, predicting behavior, and discovering patterns that structured data alone cannot reveal.`,

    semester: 3,
    subject: 'Big Data',
    unit: 'Unit I',
    content: {
      introduction: 'Unstructured data analytics is essential for extracting valuable insights from the vast majority of organizational data that lacks predefined structure.',
      definition: 'Unstructured data analytics involves applying specialized techniques and tools to analyze text, images, videos, and other non-structured information to derive meaningful insights.',
      realWorldExample: 'Amazon analyzes customer reviews, product descriptions, and social media mentions to understand sentiment and improve product recommendations.',
